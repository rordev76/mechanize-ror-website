= Mechanize Release Notes

== 0.4.3

The new syntax for finding things like forms, fields, frames, etcetera looks
like this:

page.links.with.text 'Some Text'

The preceding statement will find all links in a page with the text
'Some Text'.  This can be applied to form fields as well:

form.fields.with.name 'email'

These can be chained as well like this:

form.fields.with.name('email').and.with.value('blah@domain.com')

'with' and 'and' can be omitted, and the old way is still supported.  The
following statements all do the same thing:

form.fields.find_all { |f| f.name == 'email' }
form.fields.with.name('email')
form.fields.name('email')
form.fields(:name => 'email')

Regular expressions are also supported:

form.fields.with.name(/email/)
