= WWW::Mechanize

The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with a website.  It
can follow links, and submit forms.  Form fields can be populated and
submitted.  A history of URL's is maintained and can be queried.

== Dependencies

* ruby 1.8.2

Note that the files in the net-overrides/ directory are taken from Ruby 1.9.0.

* narf 0.6.3 (www.narf-lib.org)

  After unpacking, install it with:

    ruby install.rb config
    ruby install.rb setup
    ruby install.rb install

  Note that only the ruby-htmltools package bunded with narf works.

== Example
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mechanize'
  require 'logger'
  
  agent = WWW::Mechanize.new { |a| a.log = Logger.new("mech.log") }
  agent.user_agent_alias = 'Mac Safari'
  page = agent.get("http://www.google.com/")
  search_form = page.forms.find { |f| f.name == "f" }
  search_form.fields.find { |f| f.name == "q" }.value = "Hello"
  search_results = agent.submit(search_form)
  puts search_results.body
