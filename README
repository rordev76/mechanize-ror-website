== Dependencies

* ruby 1.8.2

Note that the files in the net-overrides/ directory are taken from Ruby 1.9.0.

* narf 0.6.3 (www.narf-lib.org)

  After unpacking, install it with:

    ruby install.rb config
    ruby install.rb setup
    ruby install.rb install

  Note that only the ruby-htmltools package bunded with narf works.
